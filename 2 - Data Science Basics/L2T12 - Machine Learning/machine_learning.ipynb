Additionally, real-time decisions, such as lane changes, stopping for pedestrians, and adjusting speed to maintain a safe following distance. The output includes control commands and decisions necessary for safe and efficient navigation.|\n| 1.2  | User profile and viewing history. The input must consist of user-specific data to make better recommendations| Personalised recommendations for movies or TV shows that the user is likely to enjoy based on their past viewing history and preferences. The output is tailored to individual user preferences, providing personalised content recommendations.          |\n| 1.3  | Scanned or captured images of signatures. The input includes the signature to be verified or identified and known signatures for comparison| Verification or identification results, indicating whether the input signature matches any known signature in the database. The output is a decision regarding the authenticity or identity associated with the input signature.          |\n| 1.4  |A patient's medical history and symptoms. The input consists of information required to determine a medial diafnosis| A diagnosis or a list of possible medical conditions, along with recommended treatment options.

The goal is to categorise emails into two discrete classes (promotional or social) based on their content and metadata. Classification algorithms are well suited for such tasks where the outcome is categorical.\n* 2.2 Regression. Stock price prediction involves predicting a continuous numeric value based on historical data and market trends. Regression models are designed for estimating numerical values, making them a suitable choice for this case.\n* 2.3 Classification. The images are classified into different categories (species of animals). Classification algorithms are suitable for this task as they deal with categorical outcomes.\n* 2.4 Classification. The goal is to classify patients into categories (e.g., having the disease or not having the disease) based on medical history and diagnostic test results. Classification models are the right choice for this problem because they deal with categorical outcomes, such as disease presence or absence.","metadata":{"id":"WgMUsqQr6qFU"},"id":"4d5be7c5-2c32-4b28-90c8-2a7a7fb98af5","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"3.

Answer here\n* 3.1 Unsupervised Learning. Unsupervised learning is suitable for anomaly detection when you don't have labelled data for specific anomaly patterns. Anomalies may not be well defined or known in advance, making unsupervised learning an appropriate approach. \n* 3.2 Supervised Learning. We have labelled data (customer lifetime value) and we want to build a model to predict this value based on historical transaction data and customer demographics. Supervised learning models are designed for making predictions when you have labelled target variables.\n* 3.3 Unsupervised Learning. The goal is to group customers based on patterns or similarities within the data itself, without predefined labels.\n* 3.4 Unsupervised Learning. The goal is to uncover hidden patterns or themes within the data without predefined categories.","metadata":{"id":"W6dTYBvd675O"},"id":"4ca17560-eab9-44fa-9a0a-af1766dd7e2b","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"4. \nFor each of the following real-world problems, determine whether it is appropriate to utilise semi-supervised machine learning algorithms.

Answer here\n* 4.1 Semi-Supervised machine learning is appropriate. The dataset has a large number of labeled transactions, making it suitable for supervised learning. However, we can also benefit from semi-supervised learning by incorporating the unlabeled data, as it can potentially help improve the models performance\n* 4.2 Semi-Supervised machine learning is appropriate. The labeled data can be used for supervised training and then leverage the vast amount of unlabeled data to improve the model's performance.\n* 4.3 Semi-supervised learning is not appropriate in this scenario. With a majority of emails labelled, we have sufficient labelled data to train a supervised model effectively.\n* 4.4 Semi-supervised learning is not appropriate. We have access to complete financial and credit-related information for credit card applicants, which allows for supervised learning. There's no need for semi-supervised learning as you have sufficient labeled data to build predictive models effectively.","metadata":{"id":"aTWugZ6q68GF"},"id":"08112182-d419-470f-a026-96e1af7cc95b","cell_type":"markdown"}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.8.10","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"},"editor":"DataCamp Workspace"},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
